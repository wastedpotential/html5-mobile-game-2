# html5-mobile-game-2

**All assets included in this repo are copyright by me - do not use them.**

Another attempt at publishing an html5 app to mobile. This version uses cordova (PhoneGap).

AS of 8-31-2022, I've packaged a basic PIXI JS html5 canvas app with cordova. All of the source files are included here. To run the app on Android:

-   `npm i` (install dependencies)
-   `npm run production` (package all html, js, etc and publish to www/ folder)
-   start an android emulator
-   `cordova emulate android`
